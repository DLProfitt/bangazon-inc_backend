# Assigning Exercises to Students

## Multi-select for Many-to-Many

> **Note:** You will need a custom view model for this task _(e.g. `StudentEditViewModel`)_

Modify your student edit form to display all exercises in a multi-select element. The user should be able to select one, or more exercises, in that element. When the user submits the form, then the `StudentExercises` table in your database should have a new entry added for each of the exercises that were selected in the form.

## Details

When you view the details of an individual student, then there should be a list of assigned exercises in the view.
