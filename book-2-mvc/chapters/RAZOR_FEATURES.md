# Building HTML Views with Razor

> **Note:** Your instruction team will provide an overview of Razor and how they are used in your MVC application.

Read about [Views in ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/overview?view=aspnetcore-3.0) to see how data is used in a Razor template.

Then, read the [Tag Helpers in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro?view=aspnetcore-3.0) article to find out how to write custom elements to inject data into your DOM. Make sure you click on the _Built-in Tag Helpers_ section to see a list of all of the ones available to you out of the box.

Initially, the [Form Tag Helper](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/working-with-forms?view=aspnetcore-3.0#the-form-tag-helper), the [Input Tag Helper](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/working-with-forms?view=aspnetcore-3.0#the-input-tag-helper), and the [Label Tag Helper](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/working-with-forms?view=aspnetcore-3.0#the-label-tag-helper) will be the ones you use the most.
