# Visual Studio Tips

Visual Studio is a very powerful IDE (integrated development environment). This chapter outlines a few of the helpful things it can do for you.

1. **Go to Files, classes, etc...** Use `ctrl+,` to open the `Go To All` search box. In this search box, you can type just about anything and Visual Studio will find it. Hit `enter` when you have selected the thing you want and Visual Studio will open it.
1. **Quickly Create Properties** When you're inside a class you can type `prop` and hit `tab` to make Visual Studio generate a property "snippet" for you.
1. **Quickly Create a Constructor** When you're inside a class you can type `ctor` to have Visual Studio generate a constructor for you.
1. **Extract an interface from an existing class** Put your cursor on the name of the class and type `ctrl+.` to open a tool menu that will give you the option of extracting an interface.
1. **Show Smart Tag (aka `ctrl+.` Super Powers)** Beyond the ability to extract interfaces `ctrl+.` can do lots of interesting and powerful things. Take some time to explore them by putting your cursor on various parts of your code and typing `ctrl+.`.
