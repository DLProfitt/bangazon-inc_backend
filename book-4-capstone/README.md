# Book 4 - Plan and Execute your Capstone

## Capstone Proposals and Approvals

Proposals for back-end capstones are somewhat less formal than they were in the front-end. This does not mean that you shouldn't diligently and thoroughly plan your project. It means we trust you to do that planning without us mandating it. It's your project and your responsibility.

However, we do require a minimal proposal before approving your capstone idea.

As in the front-end, **you _MUST_ have your proposal approved before you begin coding!** This is to prevent you from wasting your time on an unworkable capstone idea. It's always best to have a second set of eyes on a project plan before beginning. It's the software development equivalent of _"measure twice, cut once"_.

### Required Documentation

Your capstone proposal will consist of the following. This is what you will present to your capstone mentor for approval.

* A name for your project
* A short description of your project including the target user(s) of the application
* An ERD (please use dbdiagram.io)
* Basic wireframes (use any tool, or hand-draw and photographed)
* At least four user stories

Please compile the above into a Google doc that will share with your instructors.
