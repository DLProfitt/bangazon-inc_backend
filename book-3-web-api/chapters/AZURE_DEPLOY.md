# Deploying to Azure

Deploying to Microsoft Azure Cloud is a straightforward process.

## Sign Up

First you sign for a free tier account on [azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) by click the _**Start Free**_ link on the main page. You will be asked for your credit card info, but you get $200 credit which should last long enough for your job search.

## Creating a SQL Server

Next, you will deploy your database from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

Go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and once you are signed in, click on _**SQL Databases**_ on the left. Click the _Add_ button at the top and complete all of the steps for creating a new SQL Server.
