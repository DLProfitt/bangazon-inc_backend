# Revisit React

Build a React client using the `react-router-dom` package that has a navigation bar with the following items.

* Students
* Instructors
* Exercises

Clicking those navigation links will simply display a list of the corresponding resources. In addition, at the top of the list should be in an input field. As soon as the user types in any letters, the list of items should be filtered down to any items that have that string in any of the item's properties.
